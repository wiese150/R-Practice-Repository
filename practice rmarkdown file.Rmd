## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
1+100
sin(.5)
x <- 1/40
x
```

```{r}
d <- c("a","b","c")
e <- c(1.2,3.4,5.6)
d
e
e < 5
f <- 1:5
f
typeof(e)
length(e)
attributes(e)
```

```{r}
dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
# With the L suffix, you get an integer rather than a double
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
# Use TRUE and FALSE (or T and F) to create logical vectors
log_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
chr_var <- c("these are", "some strings")
```

```{r}
a <- c("a", 1)
b <- c(TRUE, 1)
c <- c(1L, 10)
d <- c(a, b, c)
typeof(a)
typeof(b)
typeof(c)
typeof(d)
# Atomic vectors can only be one type, so these are converted to the highest type by coercion rules (logical -> integer -> double -> complex -> character)
```

```{r}
x <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9))
str(x)
```

```{r}
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
x
```
